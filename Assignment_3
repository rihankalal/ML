Model Selection Exercise: Given a tabular dataset of your choice, decide which 
regression/classification model to apply—justify selection, train/test as 80/20, compare two models. 


import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\rihan\Downloads\grades.csv")

X = df[['hours_studied', 'attendance_pct']]
y = df['grade_A']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

print("Confusion Matrix:\n", cm)
print(f"Accuracy:", acc*100)
